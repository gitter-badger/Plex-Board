A dynamic dashboard for checking the status of multiple services related to Plex Media Server (Plex, Couchpotato, Sickrage, Deluge, Sabnzbd+, etc.). 

This is essentially a revamp of a cool project ([Network-Status-Page](https://github.com/scytherswings/Network-Status-Page)) I forked a little while ago.

Pronounced "Plex Dashboard" like that ghetto name [La-a][] (La Dash A)... sorry...

Here's a REALLY rough mockup of what I'm going for... I think...
